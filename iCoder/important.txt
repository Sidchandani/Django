# LEC 74
We want to manage a Single template folder which will conatins templates of all APPS
1. So, create a "templates" dir at iCoder(that conatins manage.py) create a specific dir for particular APP in APPS
2. Make a important change in settings.py of iCoder that at line 59 make 'DIRS': [], to 'DIRS': ['templates'],
i.e. make deafault dir to templates dir

#78 Post Req - after submitting the form we refer it to /conatct/ so that it inkoves the views.conatct func() 
and a model is created inside the func and the func again render it to contact.html
IF WE DON'T REFER IT TO "/CONTACT/" (for e.g. change it to '/about/') THEN IT WILL NOT ABLE TO CREATE A MODEL OF 'CONTACT'.. SO NO ENTERY WILL BE REFLECTED IN D.B.
